# Deploy and Monitor ML Pipelines with Python, Docker, and GitHub Actions


WIP...

Materials for the Deploy and Monitor ML Pipelines with Python, Docker, and GitHub Actions workshop at the [PyData NYC 2024 Conference](https://pydata.org/nyc2024/).

**When ðŸ“†:** Wednesday, November 6th, 10:50 AM EST

The workshop is based on the LinkedIn Learning course - [Data Pipeline Automation with GitHub Actions](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/data-pipeline-automation-with-github-actions-using-r-and-python/), code is available [here](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/data-pipeline-automation-with-github-actions-4503382).


**Description:** The workshop will focus on different deployment designs of machine learning pipelines using open-source applications and free-tier tools. Demonstrating with the US hourly demand for electricity live data from the EIA API, we will learn how to deploy data and ML pipeline with Python, GitHub Actions, and Docker. This includes the use of open-source tools such as Nixtla's mlforecast library to create a forecast, MLflow and pytest to monitor the health of the data and the model's success. Last but not least, we will use Quarto doc to set up the monitoring dashboard and deploy it on GitHub Pages.
